====================
Westwood Font Editor
==================== Created by Nyerguds

This editor can read and write paletted fonts of pretty much every Westwood
game ever released, plus Dune 2000, which is technically not made by Westwood.

It does not have support for RA2 fonts because paletted editing is very
different in nature than high colour editing, and all internal data in the
editor uses 8-bit images. And there's already an editor for that, anyway ;)

Have fun with it!

---------
Shortcuts
---------

The following shortcuts can be used in the editor:

[Ctrl] + C : Copy symbol
 This data can be used in the current or another Font Editor window, or can be
 pasted as image or text in other editors. The text on the clipboard will be
 the currently selected symbol in the chosen text encoding.

[Ctrl] + V : Paste symbol
 If the data was copied from Font Editor it will simply use the chosen palette.
 If it was an image, it will match its colours to the current palette.

[Ctrl] : Holding down [Ctrl] enables the Colour Picker.

[Ctrl] + [Up]    : Shift image up   
[Ctrl] + [Down]  : Shift image down	
[Ctrl] + [Left]  : Shift image left	
[Ctrl] + [Right] : Shift image right
 Hold the [Shift] key to apply this operation to all symbols.
 Hold the [Alt] key to expand the frame when shifting, to avoid losing data.

[Ctrl] + [PageUp]   : Decrease Y-offset
[Ctrl] + [PageDown] : Increase Y-offset
 Hold the [Shift] key to apply this operation to all symbols.


---------------
Adding palettes
---------------

The editor has a bunch of automatically-generated colour palettes that allow
quick visualisation of the fonts. However, if you would wish to add custom
palettes this is entirely possible too. The two types of palettes that can be
added are 16-colour palettes and 32-colour palettes.

For both of these, the editor uses the classic 256-colour palette format used
by all Westwood C&C games.

To add a 256-colour palette to the editor, simply copy the palette file into
the editor folder and restart the application.

To add a 16-colour palette, the process is slightly more complex; the editor
uses a C&C 256-colour palette for that too, but divides it up into 16 entries.
To add such a palette, add the file itself, then create a .ini file with the
same name and a [Palette] header inside it. The editor will read the entries
below that header from 0 to 15 and add them to the editor. Palettes used as
16-colour palettes will not show up in the 256-colour palette listing.

See the included 16col.ini / 16col.pal for an example. To use more entries of
16col.pal, simply edit the ini file and add names on the empty entries you
want to use.


Note that while all palettes in the editor can be edited by double-clicking
the colours on the palette, only externally loaded palettes can be saved. The
generated palettes can be modified to customize viewing of your fonts, but they
can't be saved. To edit and save fonts, add a new palette as described above.

-------------------------
Note on Dune 2000 support
-------------------------

The text encoding dropdown list has an extra "Dune 2000 text encoding" item
at the bottom. The reason for this is that the font is strangely reordered.

Dune 2000 has a text encoding translation table called "FONT.BIN", apparently
meant to line up the used special characters in the font without leaving gaps.
(Though, strangely, this isn't used to optimize the font in any way.)


For example, if you need the character "ä", that's byte 0xE4 in the text
encoding used by the game (Windows-1252; standard US / Western European).
If you look on address 0xE4 in FONT.BIN, you'll see the value there is 0x80.
This means that character "ä" is at index 0x80 (128) in the fonts.

So, in short: ä = 0xE4 ==> table index 0xE4 ==> value 0x80 => font index 0x80

(The editor actually does the reverse; going from font table index to character
by looking up in which spot in the table each index value is, but you don't
need to do that, since Dune 2000 text files are just in Windows-1252 encoding)


If you want to add fonts for a different text encoding to the game, I advise
you to get rid of this whole nonsense by replacing FONT.BIN with a 256-byte
file containing a simple sequence of bytes from 00 to FF, so each character
simply gets mapped onto itself.

-tomsons26, Omniblade and CCHyper for their research assistance.

Source code licenses
--------------------

Most of the code is licensed as WTFPL. Meaning, go nuts, do whatever the F you
want to do with it.

The PixelBox control is licensed under the Code Project Open License 1.02
(CPOL 1.02), which apparently doesn't allow its use for immoral activities.

The IniHandler is licensed under a license I made ages ago which boils down to
more or less the same as the WTFPL, but with code-only author attribution, and
endorsement of use in supervillain activities. Unlike the CPOL 1.02 :P

In essence, none of these licenses are restrictive in any way. Want to use this
code in something, go ahead. I just made this font editor so it would exist.

Just, do please adhere to Wheaton's Law: don't be a dick :)

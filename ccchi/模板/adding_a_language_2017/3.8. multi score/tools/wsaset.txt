This tool is part of the RedAlert++ toolset.
Developed by CCHyper and OmniBlade
Visit redalertpp.org for more info on the RedAlert++ project.

Usage:
    wsaset [-l -p -x # -y #] filename

    filename is without any extension or numbering.
    WSAset will look for filename ####.pcx and generate filename.wsa

    -l sets the WSA to include a loop frame.
       XCC doesn't seem to like WSA without a loop.

    -p sets if the WSA should include the palette in the file.

    -x and -y set the upper left position, defaults to 0, 0.

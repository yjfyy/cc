[this file should be viewed in DOS text encoding]

If any of the font's special characters are changed, and you need new
upper case rules for them, you need to create a conversion rules string,
and put it in the language ini file on a "CapsSpecialChars=" line.


To create a conversion rules string, view this file in the character set of
the 8-bit character encoding of your choice, and edit the original character
range given below so all lower case characters in it are replaced by their
upper case equivalents. For accented characters which don't have an uppercase
accented equivalent in the character set, the basic rule is to just use the
normal, non-accented version. If a character doesn't have an uppercase version,
just leave it.

Make sure your language file is viewed in the same text encoding as this one
at the moment you copy the conversion rules string into it.

Note that the line HAS to be exactly 127 characters long, or the system will
fail, and strings ingame will be cut off whenever the character just beyond
the given range is encountered.

General Stavros has elected you to lead
an attack on a strategic harbor the 
Soviets have overrun and fortified.

You will have to move quickly, for the 
minute that the Soviets realize that you 
are in the area, all hell will break loose.

The nearby town is somewhat sympathetic 
to the Soviet cause so you may want to 
keep close watch on them. If any of them
try to inform the Soviets of your 
presence, you have permission to 
terminate the informants.

The situation is critical! The Soviets have 
taken over a small research base in the 
north. During the conflict, a chronosphere 
was badly damaged. We fear it could 
explode.

Inside the base is a group of scientists 
that were captured during the takeover. 
They must be rescued before the 
chronosphere explode. Fight your way 
back into the base and retrieve them.

Be careful -- there is only one way in and 
out of the base, a long bridge. It must be 
protected to ensure evacuation.

; GDI Mission 1A
[GDI1A.MAP]
Name=Reinforce Phoenix Base
Briefing=GDI1A
VoiceOver=GDI-01.AUD

[GDI1A]
1=Emergency transmissions from GDI forces in this region indicate that
2=Phoenix Base is under attack from Nod troops. It is imperative that
3=the base be restored by building a Tiberium Refinery and a Barracks.
4=Once the base is functional, all Nod forces in the area must be destroyed.@@
5=Objective One: Build a Tiberium Refinery.@@
6=Objective Two: Build a Barracks.@@
7=Objective Three: Destroy all Nod forces.


; GDI Mission 2A
[GDI2A.MAP]
Name=Secure The Region
Briefing=GDI2A
VoiceOver=GDI-02.AUD

[GDI2A]
1=The Nod forces that attacked Phoenix Base have been traced back to a small
2=base in this sector. Orders received from GDI Command state that the Nod
3=base must be destroyed. However, there is a significant civilian population
4=in the immediate area that must be evacuated by ORCA Transport before the
5=fighting gets too heavy. Before the Transports can safely land, all seven
6=SAM sites must be destroyed. Once the civilians have been evacuated, the Nod
7=base can be destroyed.@@
8=Objective One: Deploy the M.C.V. and begin building a base.@@
9=Objective Two: Destroy all Nod SAM sites.@@
10=Objective Three: Destroy the Nod base.


; GDI Mission 3A
[GDI3A.MAP]
Name=Secure Crash Site
Briefing=GDI3A
VoiceOver=GDI-03A.AUD

[GDI3A]
1=GDI forces in this sector have found something unusual and large that
2=crashed nearby. Nod has taken an intense interest in whatever it is, so
3=naturally we are interested as well. Locate the object from the reports
4=and capture any Nod Technology Centers in the area that might have uncovered
5=clues as to the identity of the object.@@
6=Objective One: Locate the Crash Site.@@
7=Objective Two: Capture any Nod Technology Centers.


; GDI Mission 3B
[GDI3B.MAP]
Name=Capture Train Station
Briefing=GDI3B
VoiceOver=GDI-03B.AUD

[GDI3B]
1=Nod has positioned a supply base in the area near a civilian train
2=station. We can use the train and supplies to infiltrate the larger
3=Nod base to the east. Avoiding patrols where possible and destroy all the
4=Nod structures in the area. Once the area is secure, capture the train
5=station for our use. DO NOT destroy the station or the train, as they
6=are vital to our plans. Engineers and other reinforcements are available,
7=but not unlimited - do not waste them.@@
8=Objective One: Destroy all Nod structures.@@
9=Objective Two: Capture the train station.


; GDI Mission 4A
[GDI4A.MAP]
Name=Defend Crash Site
Briefing=GDI4A
VoiceOver=GDI-04.AUD

[GDI4A]
1=Whatever is contained in this craft, it is apparent that Nod doesn't want
2=GDI to have it. Protect the crashed UFO until GDI reinforcements can arrive
3=to fortify the area.@@
4=Objective One: Survive until reinforcements can arrive.@@
5=Objective Two: Prevent Nod from destroying the UFO.


; GDI Mission 5A
[GDI5A.MAP]
Name=Destroy Radar Array
Briefing=GDI5A
VoiceOver=GDI-05A.AUD

[GDI5A]
1=Destroy the three relay stations and the radar array to blackout Nod's
2=sensor net. This will make rescuing Tratos easier, as Nod will not be as
3=quick to detect you.@@
4=Objective One: Destroy the three relay stations.@@
5=Objective Two: Destroy the radar array.


; GDI Mission 5B
[GDI5B.MAP]
Name=Rescue Tratos
Briefing=GDI5B
VoiceOver=GDI-05B.AUD

[GDI5B]
1=Nod is experimenting on mutant survivors at a facility in this sector.
2=Among them is Tratos, leader of the mutants. Using Umagon's strike team,
3=rescue Tratos from imprisonment and EVAC him at the specified site.
4=Once complete, move in with GDI forces and destroy the Nod base and the
5=prison test facility.@@
6=Objective One: Rescue Tratos from prison.@@
7=Objective Two: EVAC Tratos at specified site.@@

; GDI Mission 6A
[GDI6A.MAP]
Name=Destroy Vega's Dam
Briefing=GDI6A
VoiceOver=GDI-06A.AUD

[GDI6A]
1=The hydroelectric dams in this area provide Vega's island fortress with
2=almost limitless power. Destroying the dams will seriously cripple Vega's
3=perimeter defenses and allow GDI to bring more weapons to bear against
4=Vega's base.@@
5=The dams are heavily fortified, so attacking them directly is not the best
6=option. Surveillance indicates the key to destroying the dams lies in the
7=destruction of two regulator stations. Without them, the dams' generators
8=will overload and the dams will self destruct.@@
9=Objective One: Destroy the dams any way possible.


; GDI Mission 6B
[GDI6B.MAP]
Name=Destroy Vega's Base
Briefing=GDI6B
VoiceOver=GDI-06B.AUD

[GDI6B]
1=Vega's base of operations is in the area. It is heavily guarded by SAM
2=sites, and a secondary outpost provides reinforcements. Destroy all Nod
3=forces in the area, but capture Vega's Pyramid intact - there is
4=information there that we can use. You will have only limited troops
5=until the SAM sites are neutralized one way or another.@@
6=Objective One: Destroy the Nod base.@@
7=Objective Two: Capture Vega's Pyramid.


; GDI Mission 7A
[GDI7A.MAP]
Name=Capture Hammerfest Base
Briefing=GDI7A
VoiceOver=GDI-07.AUD

[GDI7A]
1=Hammerfest base has been overrun by Nod troops. The Firestorm walls
2=block direct approach, so another route must be found back into the
3=complex. Using hover MLRS and waterways for access, find a way back
4=to the GDI base and re-capture it. Once the base is back in GDI hands,
5=destroy all Nod forces in the area.@@
6=Objective One: Find a way back to the GDI base.@@
7=Objective Two: Re-capture the base with engineers.@@
8=Objective Three: Destroy all Nod forces in the area.


; GDI Mission 8A
[GDI8A.MAP]
Name=Retrieve Disrupter Crystals
Briefing=GDI8A
VoiceOver=GDI-08.AUD

[GDI8A]
1=It is imperative that you prevent the train carrying the crystals from
2=reaching the Nod base. Recent ice melts in the region have washed out
3=the only train bridge. However, Nod engineers are on their way to repair
4=it, so you must move quickly. If you can get to the train before the
5=bridge is repaired, we can recover the crystals with little trouble.
6=Otherwise, we will have to assault the Nod base to reclaim the crystals.
7=Remember, to stop the train, you must destroy the locomotive, not the
8=cars, but the cargo car holds the crystals.@@
9=Objective One: Locate the train and destroy the locomotive before Nod
10=engineers repair the bridge. The cargo car holds the crystals.@@
11=Objective Two: If the bridge is repaired and the train successfully
12=reaches the Nod base, then you must locate and destroy this base to recover
13=the crystals.


; GDI Mission 9A
[GDI9A.MAP]
Name=Rescue Prisoners
Briefing=GDI9A
VoiceOver=GDI-09A.AUD

[GDI9A]
1=Umagon has requested help to rescue her people from a Nod prison.
2=The prison is located on an island to the east. Nod has a strong force
3=in the area, both in outposts and spread through the nearby city. We have
4=limited resources and no reinforcements are available, so avoiding patrols
5=is vital to your success. Umagon has a team in the area already - if you
6=can find them, they may assist you. Make your way to the prison and release
7=the hostages. Once the prison is secure, we will send a transport to evacuate
8=Umagon's people. There may be SAM sites nearby, so make sure the way is
9=clear for the transport.@@
10=Objective One: Locate the Nod prison.@@
11=Objective Two: Release and evacuate the prisoners.


; GDI Mission 9B
[GDI9B.MAP]
Name=Destroy Chemical Supply
Briefing=GDI9B
VoiceOver=GDI-09B.AUD

[GDI9B]
1=This chemical supply station is providing vast quantities of Tiberium toxins
2=to a number of Nod research programs in the area. Destroying this site will
3=seriously hinder further Nod research, and prevent this base from transporting
4=reinforcements to others in the sector.@@
5=Intelligence reports advise caution when near any of the chemical tanks and
6=facilities, as the toxins contained within are highly corrosive and equally
7=deadly to soldiers and vehicles.@@
8=Objective One: Find a suitable location for a base.
9=Objective Two: Destroy the Nod Chemical station.


; GDI Mission 9C
[GDI9C.MAP]
Name=Mine Power Grid
Briefing=GDI9C
VoiceOver=GDI-09C.AUD

[GDI9C]
1=If the upcoming GDI attack on the missile sites is to succeed, C4 must be
2=planted at all six power stations. The power grid is well protected, but the
3=train should carry the demolition team and the mutants through the gates and
4=past the guards. If Nod forces discover the demolition team and sound the alert,
5=take out the power plants by any means available.@@
6=Objective One: Plant C4 at the power plants.


; GDI Mission 9D
[GDI9D.MAP]
Name=Destroy Chemical Missile Plant
Briefing=GDI9D
VoiceOver=GDI-09D.AUD

[GDI9D]
1=Nod's main chemical missile plant is located in this area. It is responsible
2=for the large amount of Tiberium poisoning and accelerated mutations of wildlife
3=in the surrounding areas. Destroying this facility will prevent Nod from
4=furthering the acceleration of Tiberium poisoning on the planet.@@
5=Objective One: Destroy Nod's missile silos.@@
6=Objective Two: Destroy all Nod forces.


; GDI Mission 10A
[GDI10A.MAP]
Name=Destroy Prototype Facility
Briefing=GDI10A
VoiceOver=GDI-10A.AUD

[GDI10A]
1=One of two possible locations of the Prototype Manufacturing Facility. Use the
2=mutants to locate the position of the production facility. The mutants must remain
3=undetected. If Nod suspects enemy forces in the area, they will cloak the facility
4=and deploy troops to destroy them. If the mutants can hide from the Nod troops for
5=a short period, the base will assume the area is clear and uncloak. Once we
6=record the location of the base, GDI Dropships will arrive with reinforcements.@@
7=Objective One: Using mutants you must locate the Prototype Manufacturing Facility.@@
8=Objective Two: Once the facility is located, reinforcements will be sent in to help
9=construct a base. You are to destroy the Manufacturing Facility at this time.


; GDI Mission 10B
[GDI10B.MAP]
Name=Destroy Prototype Facility
Briefing=GDI10B
VoiceOver=GDI-10B.AUD

[GDI10B]
1=Another possible location of the Prototype Manufacturing Facility. Use the mutants
2=to locate the position of the production facility. They must remain undetected.
3=If Nod suspects enemy forces, they will cloak their production facility and deploy
4=troops to destroy them. If the mutants can hide from the Nod troops for a short
5=period, then Nod will assume the area is clear and uncloak the base. Once we record
6=the location of the base, GDI Dropships will arrive with reinforcements.@@
7=Objective One: Using Mutants you must locate the Prototype Manufacturing Facility.@@
8=Objective Two: Once the facility is located reinforcements will be sent into help
9=construct a base. You are to destroy the manufacturing facility at this time.

[NOD10A]
1=GDI is set to test the prototype of their new weapon, the Mammoth Mark II.
2=It is vital that we sabotage their production of this monster as soon as
3=possible. Before we can do that however, we need to know where the test is
4=being held. Send a Chameleon Spy into one of the Radar Facilities. The
5=coordinates to the testing ground should be stored there. Be careful of the
6=patrols in the area - we have only one spy available. Once we have the location
7=of the test, construct a base and destroy the prototype. You now have access to
8=the new Banshee aircraft, which should prove useful. Destroying the remainder
9=of the GDI base is at your discretion, but the Mammoth MUST be destroyed.@@

3=be of great benefit to Nod's cause. Capture the GDI outpost with engineers, then
4=disguise the base as GDI's and wait for Jake to make his inspection. When the
5=signal is given, use the Toxin soldiers provided to "persuade" Jake to join Nod's
6=forces. Once he is under our influence, EVAC him at the designated site.@@
7=@Be very careful not to alert GDI until we are ready to strike. If they detect Nod

====================
Westwood Font Editor
==================== Created by Nyerguds

This editor was originally created to read and write paletted fonts of the
Westwood Studios games. It has since been expanded to edit other paletted
fonts formats of games not made by Westwood, with focus on the Sierra Dynamix
games.

It does not have support for Red Alert 2 fonts because those are high-colour,
and paletted editing is very different in nature than high colour editing. And
there's already an editor for that, anyway ;)

Have fun with it!

---------
Shortcuts
---------

The following shortcuts can be used in the editor:

[Ctrl] + C : Copy symbol
 This data can be used in the current or another Font Editor window, or can be
 pasted as image or text in other editors. The text on the clipboard will be
 the currently selected symbol in the chosen text encoding.

[Ctrl] + V : Paste symbol
 If the data was copied from Font Editor it will simply use the chosen palette.
 If it was an image, it will match its colours to the current palette.
[Ctrl] + [Shift] + V : Paste symbol with transparency.
 Can be used to copy partial symbols. Note that the pasted content cannot be
 moved around; it will be pasted from the top left corner.

[Ctrl] : Holding down [Ctrl] enables the Colour Picker.

[Ctrl] + [Scroll Wheel] : (with editor selected) Increase/Decrease zoom.

[Ctrl] + [Up]    : Shift image up   
[Ctrl] + [Down]  : Shift image down	
[Ctrl] + [Left]  : Shift image left	
[Ctrl] + [Right] : Shift image right
 Hold the [Shift] key to apply this operation to all symbols.
 Hold the [Alt] key to expand the frame when shifting, to avoid losing data.

[Ctrl] + [PageUp]   : Decrease Y-offset
[Ctrl] + [PageDown] : Increase Y-offset
 Hold the [Shift] key to apply this operation to all symbols.


-----------------
Managing palettes
-----------------

The editor has a bunch of automatically-generated colour palettes that allow
quick visualisation of the fonts. However, if you would wish to add custom
palettes this is entirely possible too. The two types of palettes that can be
added are 16-colour palettes and 256-colour palettes. For both of these, the
editor uses the classic 256-colour palette format used by all C&C games.

Palettes can be managed and added in two ways; manually, or through the editor.
In reality, no fonts actually use 256-colour palettes, so they will probably
not be very useful, and you'll generally always use the 16-colour palette
manager built into the program. It can be accessed in the Edit menu, or when
pressing the Save button on the palette exitor controls.

This manager can also be opened for 256-colour palettes, but only through the
palette save button, since those generally don't need to be managed; you can
just dump them into the game folder and restart the editor, and that's it.

For 16-colour palettes, the process is slightly more complex; the editor uses
a C&C 256-colour palette for that too, but divides it up into 16 entries. These
entries are named, and the names are saved in a .ini file with the same name
and the palette file. The ini has a [Palette] header, and entries from 0 to 15
below that to indicate which entries are named and thus used. Palettes with
such an ini file will not show up in the 256-colour palette listing.

With the addition of the palettes manager in v1.7, edited colour palettes can
now be saved as new entries even if they are based on generated palettes.

Notes on Dune 2000 support
--------------------------

The text encoding dropdown list has an extra "Dune 2000 text encoding" item
at the bottom. The reason for this is that the font is strangely reordered.

Dune 2000 has a text encoding translation table called "FONT.BIN", apparently
meant to line up the used special characters in the font without leaving gaps.
(Though, strangely, this isn't used to optimize the font in any way.)

For example, if you need the character "ä", that's byte 0xE4 in the text
encoding used by the game (Windows-1252; standard US / Western European).
If you look on address 0xE4 in FONT.BIN, you'll see the value there is 0x80.
This means that character "ä" is at index 0x80 (128) in the fonts.

So, in short: ä = 0xE4 ==> table index 0xE4 ==> value 0x80 => font index 0x80

(The editor actually does the reverse; going from font table index to character
by looking up in which spot in the table each index value is, but you don't
need to do that, since Dune 2000 text files are just in Windows-1252 encoding)


If you want to add fonts for a different text encoding to the game, I advise
you to get rid of this whole nonsense by replacing FONT.BIN with a 256-byte
file containing a simple sequence of bytes from 00 to FF, so each character
simply gets mapped onto itself.

-tomsons26, Omniblade and CCHyper for their research assistance.
-tomsons26 for the creation of the program icon, for digging through ancient
 Westwood games, and for his tireless nagging.

Source code licenses
--------------------

Most of the code is licensed as WTFPL. Meaning, go nuts, do whatever the F you
want to do with it.

The PixelBox control is licensed under the Code Project Open License 1.02
(CPOL 1.02), which apparently doesn't allow its use for immoral activities.

The IniHandler is licensed under a license I made ages ago which boils down to
more or less the same as the WTFPL, but with code-only author attribution, and
endorsement of use in supervillain activities. Unlike the CPOL 1.02 :P

In essence, none of these licenses are restrictive in any way. Want to use this
code in something, go ahead. I just made this font editor so it would exist.

Just, do please adhere to Wheaton's Law: don't be a dick :)

Acknowledgements

The C&C1 and RA1 font format were figured out by Gordan Ugarkovic.

The Dynamix v4 format was figured out thanks to code from ScummVM. ScummVM is
licensed under the GNU General Public License, but I only used it as reference
and didn't copy or use their actual code.

The Dynamix decompression code was converted from the C++ code of VOGONS.org
user tikalat's Midi Tools. It contains no license but I assume the fact he
included the code implies that he doesn't mind it being useful to more people.
